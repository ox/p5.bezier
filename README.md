# p5.bezier

Hi! Don't wait and let **p5.bezier**, a [p5.js](https://p5js.org) library, help you draw the smoothest curves like never before. You can regard the library as an advanced version of the original p5.js `bezier()` function which takes no less or more than 4 points while cannot draw higher level curves. The p5.bezier library allows you to draw continuous and closed bezier curves easily.

```
newBezier([[85, 20], [10, 10], [90, 90], [15, 80]]);
```

**This project is still WIP.**
